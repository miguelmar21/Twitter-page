# Mock Twitter Page




This project is a replica of Elon Musk's Twitter page that is built using a mock API. The purpose of the project is practice both CSS and DOM manipulation using JavaScript. The idea for this project was brought upon me by Aaron Jack, a software developer who makes tutorials and other useful videos on youtube. 

This twitter page is completely responsive and mobile friendly.

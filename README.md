# Mock Twitter Page

![twitter-page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76494184/150390321-f7d80ee2-3d77-4f19-97c8-c71ca9c0cbb8.gif)

This project is a replica of Elon Musk's Twitter page that is built using a mock API. The purpose of the project is practice both CSS and DOM manipulation using JavaScript. The idea for this project was brought upon me by Aaron Jack, a software developer who makes tutorials and other useful videos on youtube. 

This twitter page is completely responsive and mobile friendly.
